# woo-framework-shortcodes
WooThemes uses WooFramework which comes with loads of shortcodes, if you have used the theme for a long time you may have used the 
shortcodes in your pages. Switching over to another theme becomes difficult as the shortcodes aren't supported in a non WooTheme. 
With the help of this plugin easily switch to a non WooThemes theme but retain the framework shortcodes.

## DisclaimerI ha
Please note this is not an official WooThemes plugin. This plugin was created with the hope that it will help someone switch to another theme like Storefront that doesn't have shortcodes that are provided by a WooThemes theme. All the copyrights and
